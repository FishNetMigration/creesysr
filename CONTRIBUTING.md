# Contributing

## New function
Within a package structure, functions live within the `R/` directory. Each function also a has corresponding `*.md` file that resides in the `man/` directory. The `*.md` files are the help files that appear when `?myfunction` is called or when previewed in RStudio.

```
├── R
│   ├── make_FR711.R
│   ├── make_FR712.R
├── man
│   ├── make_FR711.md
│   ├── make_FR712.md

```

## Roxygen skeleton
The `*.R` file that contains special *roxygen* header text denoted by `#'` that is used to generate the `*.md` file. The *roxygen skeleton* is easily added to the `*.R` file from RStudio when the cursor is inside the function body and then accessing the *magic wand* drop down menu or using *ctrl+alt+shift+r* .

``` r
#' hello creesys
#'
#' @return str "hello creesys"
#' @export
#' @description
#' This function only returns 'hello creesys' but
#' is here as a simple example of how to write functions.
#'
#' @examples
#' hello_creesys()

hello_creesys <- function(){
  "hello creesys"
}

```

## Generating the *.md file
The `*.md` files can be generated by calling `devtools::document`. When contributing functions to `creesysr` however these files will be generated through a [Github action](.github) workflow when the `*.R` file is pushed to the repository. The Github Action recognizes that a new function or changes to an existing function has occurred and will run the `devtools::document` command in a background job and will create or update the `*.md` file and then commit it to the working branch.  

## General function structure
The package analysis workflow will (*generally?*) require functions that accept a dataframe that resembles the Fishnet (FN2) naming conventions and creates a new FN2 table and as such functions should generally be named based on the new table that is generated.

``` r
# load raw data
## FN2 zip files can be read using gfsR::import_creel_series
creel_file <- "Data/SC07_WPR/DATA.ZIP"
wpgcreel <- import_creel_series(creel_file)

# Create table dataframe from list item
FN111 <- wpgcreel$FN111

# Step 1
FR711 <- make_FR711(FN111)

# Step 2
FR712 <- make_FR712(FR711)
```
